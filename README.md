I created this app for anyone doing interior design fabrication. 
This app can be used anywhere. Even at home.
Instead of doing things on paper, measurements, fabric choices,and other
things(like products that can be sold) can be created electronically
and stored in a database, for later.
Having the ability to create an invoice and quotes from 1 application is a nice feature to have.
Emailing the customer the details of any fabrication job, even if the job has yet to happen.
Having a map, that is accessible from the contact list instead of opening up a new application
makes this easier for the user to get to whatever location the job is at.
